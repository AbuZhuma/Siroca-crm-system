# CRM System for Siroka Technologies

This project is the frontend component of a CRM system developed for Siroka Technologies. Utilizing a modern stack and advanced tools, this application ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), only a portion of the system's features are disclosed in this document.

## Technologies

The project incorporates a range of technologies and tools:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create reusable UI components and manage the application’s state.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster development experience with support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript features.
- **Zustand**: A state management library for React, offering a simple and scalable approach to managing application state.
- **Ant Design (antd)**: A comprehensive UI framework providing a set of high-quality components and design guidelines for building elegant user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend and handling responses.
- **React Router DOM**: A library for routing and navigation in React applications, enabling dynamic URL handling and component rendering.
- **clsx**: A utility for conditionally joining CSS class names together, making it easier to manage dynamic styles.
- **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, improving the maintainability of styles.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code, helping maintain code quality and consistency.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: A Vite plugin that adds support for React’s JSX syntax and features.
- **@types/**: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js, React, and other libraries, ensuring type safety and autocompletion.
